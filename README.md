<br>
Well, you asked for it!Curious adventurers have always wondered if the stories they’ve heard about a number of hidden treasures were true. The legend says whoever may find all of them will live the most fortunate life.
The treasures are said to be located in the heart of a forest known as “The Enchanted Forest” where many unusual creatures can be discovered. Some of them are really friendly and want to help everyone that may pay them a visit, while others find strangers dangerous and will do anything to protect the forest and its riches. Many tried to step into the mysterious woods, but few came out. 
One courageous traveller decided to find for themselves if all of this is true.

<br>
This project was developed as the final project for the Software Developing Methods course at The Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Unibuc. 
We worked in a team consisting of 3 persons, and we constructed the game from scratch, using Unity as our game engine and Plastic SCM and Github for source control. 
We implemented player movements, sound management, player-interaction with the environment and enemy behaviours using C# scripts.
